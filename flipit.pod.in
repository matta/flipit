=head1 NAME

flipit - control the X10 Firecracker (CM17A)

=head1 SYNOPSIS

S<flipit [B<flip> B<(a-p)(1-16)> B<(on|off)>] [repeat...]>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes flipit version @VERSION@.

Flipit allows you to control X10 devices with your Unix computer by
means of a Firecracker (model number CM17A) plugged into a serial
port.

X10 is a method of transmitting control commands to devices over
regular home power lines.  The Firecracker is a device manufactured by
X10 Ltd.  See http://www.x10.com/ for product information.

For more information, see http://www.lickey.com/flipit/.

=head1 OPTIONS

Flipit has a simple command structure.  The first argument must always
be 'flip.'  The next argument is a device specifier.  Device
specifiers are comprised of a house code (a letter "a" to "p") and a
device code (a number 1 to 16).  The next argument is either "on" or
"off."  These three arguments can be repeated in this sequence, which
allows to turn more than one device on or off at a time.

=head1 ERRORS

If everything goes well, flipit will exit with a value of zero.  Upon
error, it will print the reason why on stderr and exit with a non-zero
exit value.

=head1 EXAMPLES

The following will turn device 5 in house code B on:

C<flipit flip b5 on>

The following will first turn device 10 in house code C off, then turn
device 16 in house code A on:

C<flipit flip c10 off flip a16 on>

=head1 FILES

flipit reads the filename of the tty device to use from the
F<flipit.conf> file.  The F<flipit.conf> file is usually in the
F</usr/local/etc> directory, but can be changed at compile time.

=head1 NOTES

This is an ALPHA version of flipit.  Not all features are implemented.

A similar and more full featured program is called BottleRocket.

=head1 BUGS

Flipit doesn't create any lock files when accessing the tty.

=head1 RESTRICTIONS

Flipit does no security checking itself.  If it finds that it can open
the tty device named in F<flipit.conf> it will be happy to do so.
