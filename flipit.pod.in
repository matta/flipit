=head1 NAME

flipit - control the X10 Firecracker (CM17A)

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 flipit [-h] [-t tty] [COMMAND ARGS] [COMMAND ARGS]...

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes flipit version @VERSION@.

Flipit allows you to control X10 devices with your Unix computer by
means of a Firecracker (model number CM17A) plugged into a serial
port.

X10 is a method of transmitting control commands to devices over
regular home power lines.  The Firecracker is a device manufactured by
X10 Ltd.  See http://www.x10.com/ for product information.

=head1 OPTIONS

First pass any options to flipit, then pass any commands.  For a list of
commands, see the COMMANDS section below.  Now, for the options...

=over 4

=item help

  -h

Displays the usage message.

=item tty

  -t tty

Set the tty flipit will use.  This is usually set in the configuration
file F<flipit.conf>, but this option lets you override it, mainly for
testing purposes.

=back

=head1 COMMANDS

After any of the above options, you pass any number of commands on the
command line.  The commands are flip, dim and brighten.

Most of the commands take a "device-specifier" argument.  This is just
a way to specify a given X10 device with a string of characters.
Device specifiers are comprised of a house code (a letter "a" to "p")
and a device code (a number 1 to 16).  E.g. a10

For concrete examples, see the EXAMPLES section.

=over 4

=item brighten

  brighten device-specifier steps

Brighten a device by a given number of steps.  Steps can be from 1 to 6.

=item dim

  dim device-specifier steps

Dim a device by a given number of steps.  Steps can be from 1 to 6.

=item flip

  flip device-specifier on|off

Flip a device on or off.  The first argument is a device specifier
(see above).  The next argument is either "on" or "off."

=back

=head1 ERRORS

If everything goes well, flipit will exit with a value of zero.  Upon
error, it will print the reason why on stderr and exit with a non-zero
exit value.

=head1 EXAMPLES

The following will turn device 5 in house code B on:

C<flipit flip b5 on>

The following will first turn device 10 in house code C off, then turn
device 16 in house code A on:

C<flipit flip c10 off flip a16 on>

The following will dim device a5 by 2 steps, then brighten device d7 by 4
steps.

C<flipit dim a5 2 brighten d7 4>

=head1 FILES

flipit reads the filename of the tty device to use from the
F<flipit.conf> file.  The F<flipit.conf> file is usually in the
F</usr/local/etc> directory, but can be changed at compile time.

=head1 NOTES

This is an ALPHA version of flipit.  Not all features are implemented.

A similar and more full featured program is called BottleRocket.

=head1 BUGS

Flipit doesn't create any lock files when accessing the tty.  There should at
least be an option to do this for those using the cm17a on the same serial
port as their modem or similar.

There are reports of the brighten command always taking the lamp to the full
brightness.  I haven't been able to reproduce that here.  Some have suggested
to me that this happens only with older lamp controllers.  Any suggestions or
fixes are appreciated.

=head1 RESTRICTIONS

Flipit does no security checking itself.  If it finds that it can open
the tty device named in F<flipit.conf> it will be happy to do so.
