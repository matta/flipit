By default, flipit relies _entirely_ on Unix file permissions for security.  If
it can open the serial port's tty device in flipit.conf, then it will happily
access that port.

It does this because any other security mechanism can be worked around by the
user simply compiling their own copy of flipit.  In other words, if a user can
open the port's tty device, they can mess with your cm17a anyway.

I'm wrong here, please let me know.
